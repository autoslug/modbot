## Development
Please see [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fgh690OpJsaQWVYQWsDYn1djbTpzN0oVngfRYCa8dfM/edit) for an explanation of the branch/folder organization for this repository. Since the final code will end up on a Raspberry Pi and several Picos, the top-level "final product" directories will be `/pi` and `/pico`, in addition to the `/dev` directory
